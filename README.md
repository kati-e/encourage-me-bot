A simple react app using the openAI api to give words of encouragement when the button is clicked.

1. In the root dir run:
npm i
npm run dev

This will open the app up on https://localhost:3000/

2. You will need to sign up for an api key with openAI to use this. You can do that here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3. Once you have your api key you will need to create a .env file to keep it in. Like this:

``` NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY = {Your Key Here} ```

Hope you enjoy it! \(^_^)/
